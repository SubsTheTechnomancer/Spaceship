# Spaceship
 A text-based adventure about an alien invasion, with a twist.

# How to play
 Unless you have SDL and the Image and TTF libraries in the correct areas and have changed the makefile, you cannot compile the game.   First download SDL, SDL_Image and SDL_TTF, follow instructions to copy certain libraries and bin files to your MinGW root, and change the  Makefile given to the appropriate locations in your SDL folders. (Use 32 bit versions only)

Instructions to play are really simple and are given in the main menu of the game. You can, aside from typing EXIT, press Escape to close the game. Currently only has the main menu without leaderboards and a sample first scene.

# Reminder to myself
 add -Wl,-subsystem,windows back to the makefile after game is finished
